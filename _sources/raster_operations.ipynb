    "Raster data represents continuous spatial information such as elevation, temperature, or land cover. In Python, the `rasterio` and `matplotlib` libraries provide efficient tools for working with raster data, allowing users to visualize, analyze, and manipulate raster layers. Some common operations include plotting, reclassification, clipping, and masking, among others. These operations enable users to extract specific information and tailor raster datasets to their analysis needs."
